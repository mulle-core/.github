# mulle-core

*mulle-core* provides functionality that is outside of the C standard libraries.
These libraries are not strictly concerned with concurrency like *mulle-concurrent* is,
but may use features of mulle-concurrent. So *mulle-core* is a grabbag of libraries, that
is set to grow and that might get reorganized into more topical library 
collections later on.
*mulle-core* is based on [mulle-concurrent](//github.com/mulle-concurrent) and 
[mulle-c](//github.com/mulle-c). 

The [MulleFoundation](https://MulleFoundation.github.io) is based on *mulle-core*.
